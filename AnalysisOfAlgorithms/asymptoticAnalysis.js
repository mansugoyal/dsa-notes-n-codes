/*1. What is Asymptotic Analysis?

Asymptotic Analysis is a way to measure the efficiency of an algorithm as the size of the input (n) grows very large.

It ignores:

Machine speed

Programming language

Constant factors

It focuses only on how the algorithmâ€™s runtime (or memory usage) grows compared to the size of input.

Think of it as:

"How does the algorithm behave when n becomes huge?"*/
